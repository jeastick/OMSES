# OMSES
Optimal Mine Site Energy Supply 

This repository holds the OMSES_DE.py and OPlots.py programs, and Microsoft Excel input file templates for the "design envelope" formulation of optimal mine site energy supply design envelope (OMSES_DE).

The following python dependencies are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

The python program OMSES_DE.py formulates a design envelope OMSES problem using the Gurobi solver Python API. A license for the Gurobi solver can be purchased or requested from Gurobi at www.gurobi.com.

The python program OPlots.py uses matplotlib to generate interactive or static plots of the results from an OMSES_DE object. 

A forewarning: this program was developed for personal academic use for research works. Software development best practices were not particularly followed.
